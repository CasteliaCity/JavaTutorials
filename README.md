# Lambda Corps -- From Zero to Robot Tutorials

These lessons are designed to take someone (you) that has little to no programming experience, and get them understanding the basics of programming.  As a team, we use the Java programming language to program our robots.  Java is useful for a wide variety of projects out there, robots or not. For our (your) purposes, it's a great introductory language to learn all the concepts you'll need to start programming for both robotics and any other projects you might want to try on your own.
